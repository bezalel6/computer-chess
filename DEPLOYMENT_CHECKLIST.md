# Deployment Checklist

Quick reference checklist for deploying Computer Chess to production.

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Production Database
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL database (Neon/Supabase/Railway)
- [ ] Copy connection string
- [ ] Test connection locally
- [ ] Save DATABASE_URL securely

**Recommended:** [Neon](https://neon.tech) - Free tier with 0.5GB storage

### 2. Pusher Account
- [ ] Sign up at [pusher.com](https://pusher.com)
- [ ] Create new Channels app
- [ ] Note App ID, Key, Secret, Cluster
- [ ] Test with development environment

**Free Tier:** 200k messages/day, 100 connections

### 3. NextAuth Secret
- [ ] Generate secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] Save securely (password manager)
- [ ] Never commit to git

### 4. Git Repository
- [ ] Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes `.env.local`
- [ ] Remove any sensitive data from history
- [ ] Tag release version (optional)

---

## Vercel Deployment

### 1. Initial Setup
- [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
- [ ] Login: `vercel login`
- [ ] Navigate to project: `cd computer-chess-next`

### 2. Deploy Preview
- [ ] Run: `vercel`
- [ ] Choose project settings (or create new)
- [ ] Note preview URL
- [ ] Test preview deployment

### 3. Environment Variables
Add in Vercel dashboard (Settings > Environment Variables):

**Database:**
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` = Your production database URL

**NextAuth:**
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = Generated secret (openssl)
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = `https://your-app.vercel.app`

**Pusher Server:**
- [ ] `PUSHER_APP_ID` = From Pusher dashboard
- [ ] `PUSHER_KEY` = From Pusher dashboard

**Pusher Client:**
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY` = Same as PUSHER_KEY
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER` = Same as PUSHER_CLUSTER

### 4. Database Migration
```bash
# Set production database URL
export DATABASE_URL="your-production-url"

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify
npx prisma studio
```

- [ ] Export DATABASE_URL
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Verify tables created
- [ ] (Optional) Seed test users

### 5. Production Deployment
- [ ] Run: `vercel --prod`
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Note production URL
- [ ] Check deployment logs

## Monitoring Setup

### Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Open project in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Bookmark deployment URL
- [ ] Enable email notifications (optional)
- [ ] Check "Analytics" tab

**Monitor:**
- Deployment status
- Runtime logs
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

### Pusher Dashboard
- [ ] Open Pusher dashboard
- [ ] Select your app
- [ ] Open "Debug Console"
- [ ] Monitor message activity

**Watch for:**
- Connection count
- Message volume
- Error rate
- Daily usage

### Database Monitoring
- [ ] Access database dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed
```bash
# Check build logs
vercel logs

# Rebuild locally
npm run build

# Check for errors
npm run lint
```

### Database Connection Error
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
