## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Move Sync**
   - Moves stored in database but not pushed live
   - Players need to poll or refresh
   - **Fix:** Add Pusher/Socket.IO (instructions in MIGRATION_GUIDE)

2. **Challenge Generation Latency**
   - First challenge can take 1-2 seconds
   - Stockfish analysis limited to 100ms/move
   - **Fix:** Pre-generate or increase analysis time

3. **Simple Matchmaking**
   - FIFO queue without skill matching
   - No queue timeout handling
   - **Fix:** Add ELO ratings and cleanup job

4. **Database Polling**
   - No automatic opponent move updates
   - Manual refresh needed
   - **Fix:** Add WebSocket real-time layer

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Real-Time Communication (Priority 1)**
   - Add Pusher for move synchronization
   - Live opponent presence
   - Instant challenge updates

2. **Game Controls**
   - Resign button
   - Draw offers
   - Rematch requests
   - Undo move (in casual games)

3. **User Features**
   - Player profiles
   - ELO rating system
   - Match history
   - Game replay viewer

4. **Social Features**
   - Friends list
   - In-game chat
   - Spectator mode
   - Tournament system

## Deployment Instructions

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Next.js 15 migration"
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` from Vercel Postgres
   - Add `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Add `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your deployment URL

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Alternative: Railway

1. Create Railway project
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Add PostgreSQL plugin
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy automatically on push

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Chess Board Rendering**
   - Wrap in `React.memo` if re-renders are slow
   - Debounce move validation

2. **Challenge Generation**
   - Move to server-side with caching
   - Pre-generate common positions
   - Increase Stockfish worker pool

3. **Database Queries**
   - Add indexes for common queries
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement query caching

4. **Asset Loading**
   - Compress sound files
   - Use Next.js Image optimization
   - Lazy load Stockfish

### Bundle Size

Current bundle includes:
- chess.ts (~50KB)
- react-chessboard (~30KB)
- Zustand (~3KB)
- Stockfish (loaded as Web Worker, not in bundle)

**Total bundle:** ~200KB (acceptable for modern web)
