```

### State Management Philosophy
- **Server State**: Prisma + Server Actions (database)
- **Client State**: Zustand (UI, game, challenges)
- **Real-time State**: Pusher (move sync, scores)

### Key Patterns
- Server Components by default, 'use client' only when needed
- Type-safe Server Actions with Zod validation
- Singleton pattern for Prisma, Pusher, Stockfish, Sounds
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive Stockfish analysis
- Optimistic updates with database reconciliation

## What's Different from Original

### Improvements ✨

**Architecture**
- ❌ Class components → ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ❌ Prop drilling → ✅ Zustand state management
- ❌ Mixed client/server → ✅ Clear separation (Server Components)
- ❌ PeerJS P2P → ✅ Centralized Pusher (more reliable)

**Developer Experience**
- ❌ Vite → ✅ Next.js (better DX, built-in backend)
- ❌ Manual routing → ✅ File-based routing
- ❌ No type safety → ✅ Full TypeScript coverage
- ❌ Manual API → ✅ Server Actions (type-safe RPC)

**Production**

## Known Limitations

1. **No WebSocket fallback** - Pusher handles this automatically with long-polling
2. **Basic matchmaking** - No skill-based matching or time preferences
3. **No game abandonment handling** - Players can just close tab (could add timeout)
4. **No reconnection after disconnect** - Page refresh required
5. **Simple challenge pool** - Only 3 challenge types currently

All limitations are acceptable for MVP and can be addressed in future updates.
