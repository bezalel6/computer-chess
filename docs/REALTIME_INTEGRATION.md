## How It Works

### Architecture Flow

```
Player A Browser                 Server                    Player B Browser
     │                              │                             │
     │  1. Make move               │                             │
     ├──────────────────────────>  │                             │
     │                              │                             │
     │  2. Save to DB              │                             │
     │     + Trigger Pusher event  │                             │
     │                              ├──────────────────────────>  │
     │                              │  3. Pusher broadcasts       │
     │                              │     opponent:move event     │
     │                              │                             │
     │                              │  4. RealtimeProvider        │
     │                              │     receives event          │
     │                              │                             │
     │                              │  5. Game store updates      │
     │                              │                             │
     │                              │  6. Board re-renders        │
     │                              │     with new position       │
```

### Event Types

| Event | Channel | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `opponent:move` | `match-{id}` | Notify opponent of new move |
| `opponent:score` | `match-{id}` | Update opponent score display |
| `match:start` | `match-{id}` | Notify both players game started |
| `match:end` | `match-{id}` | Notify both players game ended |
| `challenge:received` | `user-{id}` | Notify user of friend challenge |

### Data Flow

1. **Player makes move** → Client calls `submitMove()` server action
2. **Server validates** → Checks authentication, game state
3. **Server saves** → Writes move to database
4. **Server triggers** → Sends Pusher event to match channel
5. **Pusher broadcasts** → Delivers event to all subscribed clients
6. **Client receives** → RealtimeProvider catches event
7. **Store updates** → Game store applies opponent's move
8. **UI re-renders** → Chess board shows updated position

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Pusher Account Setup

1. Visit [pusher.com](https://pusher.com)
2. Sign up (free tier: 200k messages/day, 100 connections)
3. Create a new "Channels" application
4. Copy credentials from dashboard:
   - App ID
   - Key
   - Secret
   - Cluster

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
PUSHER_APP_ID="123456"
PUSHER_KEY="abc123def456"
PUSHER_SECRET="secret123abc"
PUSHER_CLUSTER="us2"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY="abc123def456"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER="us2"
```

### 3. Testing

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open two browser windows
# - Window 1: http://localhost:3000
# - Window 2: http://localhost:3000 (incognito/different browser)

# Login as different users
# Start a match
# Make moves and verify instant synchronization
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Pusher server client configured
- [x] Pusher browser client configured
- [x] RealtimeProvider component created
- [x] Server actions trigger Pusher events
- [x] Game page wrapped with provider
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Deployment guide created
- [x] README updated with real-time info
- [x] Migration guide updated

## Production Deployment

See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for complete instructions.

### Quick Steps

1. Create production Pusher app
2. Setup production database (Neon/Supabase/Railway)
3. Deploy to your hosting provider
4. Add environment variables in hosting dashboard
5. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
6. Test with two devices

## Performance Considerations

### Pusher Free Tier Limits

- **Messages:** 200,000 per day (~6,800/hour)
- **Connections:** 100 max concurrent
- **Channels:** Unlimited

### Estimated Capacity

For average game of 30 moves:
- **6,000+ games per day**
- **50 concurrent games**

Sufficient for MVP and early growth.

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade to Pusher paid plan ($49/month) when:
- Concurrent users >50
- Daily games >5,000
- Need more than 100 connections

## Debugging

### Browser Console

Look for these logs:
```javascript
[Pusher] Connected
[Realtime] Subscribing to match-abc123
[Realtime] Successfully subscribed to match channel
[Realtime] Received opponent move: { from: "e2", to: "e4" }
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Missing Pusher configuration"
- **Fix:** Verify all Pusher env vars are set
- **Check:** `PUSHER_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY` both set

**Issue:** Moves don't sync
- **Fix:** Check Pusher dashboard for message activity
- **Check:** Browser console for connection errors
- **Verify:** Match ID is passed to RealtimeProvider

**Issue:** Connection fails immediately
- **Fix:** Verify cluster matches your Pusher app
- **Check:** `PUSHER_CLUSTER` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER`

### Pusher Dashboard

Monitor real-time activity:
1. Go to pusher.com dashboard
2. Select your app
3. Click "Debug Console"
4. Watch for events when moves are made

## Security Notes

- Pusher credentials are split: server-side and public
- `PUSHER_SECRET` never sent to browser
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables exposed to client
- Channel names include match IDs (no cross-game leakage)
- Future: Add Pusher auth for private channels

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Presence Channels**
   - Show when opponent is online
   - Display "opponent is typing" indicators

2. **Private Channels**
   - Add authentication for extra security
   - Prevent unauthorized subscriptions

3. **Connection Status UI**
   - Show connection state to users
   - Reconnection logic for network issues

4. **Event History**
   - Store recent events for reconnection
   - Replay missed moves on connection restore

## Summary

The Computer Chess application now has production-ready real-time communication:

- ✅ Instant move synchronization between players
- ✅ Real-time score updates
- ✅ Match notifications
- ✅ Scalable architecture (Pusher)
- ✅ Complete deployment documentation
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

**The app is now ready for production deployment.**
